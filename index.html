        <h1>My name is Keerthana</h1>
        <p>Currently, I am a student and I already have a little bit of web development experience. My favorite part of developing websites is seeing it all come together at the end. I also enjoy choosing a color palette for a website because making a website look aesthetically pleasing is very important to me. I will admit that sometimes, for me, choosing the color palette can be one of the hardest parts of making the website. In my free time, enjoy listening to music, reading, and crocheting.</p>
